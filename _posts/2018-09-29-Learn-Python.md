This article list downs the things that you would need most frequently while working exploring and manipulating datasets. It will be easy, if you've already taken a basic course on Python. Don't worry you can start for now without any experience.

### Let's start

**Step 0: Download **

> [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and  [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

We'll be using Python 3 in this article.
After installing fire up your Spyder(IDE) or Jupyter(notebook) to start coding

### Libraries
Apart from basic things you would need libraries for most of the functions. The most frequently used libraries for data science are
> Numpy
> Pandas
> Scipy
> Scikit-Learn
> Matplotlib

To download libraries either use command prompt OR anaconda prompt . You can also download them from  Jupyter/IPython notebook

```python
#From command prompt
pip install pandas

#If you don't have root access on your Linux/Unix terminal
sudo pip install pandas

#From Jupyteer
!pip install twitter
```
You need to import these libraries before you use them

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```
